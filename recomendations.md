# NRFI.py Model Roadmap & Checklist

# NRFI.py Advanced Model Enhancements (Cross-Platform)

## Multi-Class Prediction Model
- [ ] Expand model to predict four outcomes instead of binary:
   - [ ] NRFI (no runs scored by either team)
   - [ ] Home team scores in first inning (away doesn't)
   - [ ] Away team scores in first inning (home doesn't)
   - [ ] Both teams score in first inning
- [ ] Implement hierarchical classification:
   - [ ] First predict if any runs will be scored
   - [ ] Then predict which team(s) will score
- [ ] Add custom loss functions that penalize certain misclassification types more heavily
- [ ] Develop specialized confidence metrics for each prediction class

## Advanced Feature Engineering
- [ ] Add umpire-specific features (first inning strike zone tendencies)
- [ ] Incorporate time of day and day of week performance patterns
- [ ] Add travel fatigue factors (distance traveled, time zone changes)
- [ ] Include ballpark-specific dimensions and their effect on scoring
- [ ] Develop pitcher-specific first-batter-faced statistics
- [ ] Track team performance based on batting order construction
- [ ] Add features for recent team momentum and scoring streaks
- [ ] Incorporate weather trend information (changing conditions)
- [ ] Develop pitcher vs. specific batter matchup metrics
- [ ] Add features for team performance in series openers vs. later games

## Model Architecture Improvements
- [ ] Experiment with neural networks for pattern recognition
- [ ] Implement ensemble methods with different base classifiers
- [ ] Add recurrent neural networks for sequence data (game-to-game patterns)
- [ ] Try XGBoost and LightGBM implementations with custom objectives
- [ ] Implement probability calibration specialized for multi-class predictions
- [ ] Add Bayesian methods for uncertainty estimation
- [ ] Explore time-series specific models that capture seasonal trends
- [ ] Implement feature selection with recursive feature elimination
- [ ] Try deep learning approaches for automatic feature extraction

## Evaluation and Performance Metrics
- [ ] Create custom evaluation metrics for each prediction class
- [ ] Add ROI/betting-oriented evaluation framework
- [ ] Implement class-specific calibration curves
- [ ] Develop expected value calculation for each prediction
- [ ] Add confidence intervals for predictions
- [ ] Create visualization for prediction distribution across outcomes
- [ ] Implement model comparison framework for A/B testing new approaches
- [ ] Add Monte Carlo simulations for value assessment
- [ ] Develop backtesting for specific betting strategies

## Real-Time Integration
- [ ] Add real-time lineup update handling
- [ ] Implement feature for last-minute pitcher changes
- [ ] Add weather condition updates close to game time
- [ ] Create real-time model re-training capability
- [ ] Add streaming predictions updated with new information
- [ ] Implement webhooks for external data providers
- [ ] Create API endpoints for real-time prediction access
- [ ] Add notification system for significant prediction changes

## Explainability and Analysis
- [ ] Implement SHAP values for prediction explanation
- [ ] Add feature contribution visualization for each prediction
- [ ] Create case-based reasoning for similar historical games
- [ ] Add what-if analysis tool for hypothetical scenarios
- [ ] Implement anomaly detection for unusual prediction patterns
- [ ] Create confidence threshold recommendations based on expected value
- [ ] Add post-game analysis comparing prediction to actual outcome
- [ ] Develop specialized explanations for each prediction class
